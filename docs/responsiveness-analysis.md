# Frontend Responsiveness Assessment

## Overview
The frontend uses Tailwind CSS utilities in a mobile-first fashion: base classes target phones while `sm:`/`md:` modifiers progressively enhance layouts for larger screens. The client portal now leans on card-first presentations with desktop tables rendered only at wider breakpoints so small devices receive lightweight markup.

## Confirmed mobile-first patterns
- The client matters list defaults to stacked cards with action buttons sized for touch, then elevates to a desktop table above the `md` breakpoint. Loading skeletons mirror the mobile structure so perceived performance stays consistent across devices.【F:frontend/src/features/client/ClientMattersPage.tsx†L37-L188】
- Matter detail tabs (documents, invoices, messages) deliver card-based layouts with responsive pagination controls, while desktop-only tables remain scoped behind `md` gates to avoid redundant DOM weight on phones.【F:frontend/src/features/client/ClientMatterDetailPage.tsx†L190-L386】
- Shared UI primitives (`Button`, `Skeleton`, responsive flex utilities) keep spacing compact on mobile via `p-4 sm:p-6` patterns, easing readability on 320–360px wide screens.【F:frontend/src/features/client/ClientMattersPage.tsx†L104-L191】【F:frontend/src/features/client/ClientMatterDetailPage.tsx†L330-L390】

## Recent fixes
- Resolved lingering merge conflict markers in client portal files and backend modules that previously broke builds and halted responsive audits.【F:frontend/src/features/client/ClientMattersPage.tsx†L1-L199】【F:frontend/src/features/client/ClientMatterDetailPage.tsx†L1-L398】【F:backend/accounts/views.py†L1-L220】
- Normalized organization permission helpers and billing imports to remove merge-artifact imports while keeping role-based guards intact.【F:backend/accounts/permissions.py†L1-L44】【F:backend/billing/views.py†L1-L200】

## Recommendations
1. Consider conditionally fetching table data only for desktop clients if dataset size becomes large to minimize network usage on mobile.
2. Add automated viewport regression tests (e.g., Playwright) to lock in the current responsive behavior for future releases.
3. Monitor padding scale changes after real-device QA to ensure touch targets remain accessible without crowding content on smaller screens.
