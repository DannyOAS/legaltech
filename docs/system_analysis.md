# System Remediation Summary

## Merge Conflicts Resolved
- Cleaned `backend/accounts/permissions.py`, `backend/accounts/views.py`, `backend/billing/views.py`, `backend/matters/models.py`, and `backend/services/audit/views.py` so the project imports without syntax errors.
- Restored stable React implementations for `ClientMattersPage` and `ClientMatterDetailPage`, removing merge debris and the missing `resetStatus` helper that previously broke runtime behaviour.

## Frontend â†” Backend Integrations Repaired
- Re-enabled client portal messaging by allowing authenticated client users through the message thread and message viewsets while preserving per-matter access controls.
- Ensured calculated deadlines requested by the UI are persisted whenever `save_deadlines` is true, aligning backend behaviour with the client expectation.

These fixes bring the repository back to a working baseline so functional enhancements can proceed safely.
